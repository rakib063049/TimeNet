<h3>“Time is money”</h3><p>We’ve all heard that saying, but until your livelihood comes directly from billing clients for your time it is hard to fully grasp how true that really is.  The difference between running a business vs. a charity is making sure that your time spent working on a specific project or for a client is tracked, measured, billed and collected.  This process is complicated enough with 1 person working on a single project, or with a single customer.  Adding more staff working for multiple customers all with many projects in our multi-tasking, everybody-needs-it-yesterday world makes keeping detailed track of who is doing what/when all the more difficult.  It is well past due for a technology tool to assist with this process be more than glorified stopwatch.</p>
<h3>That time is here, with Dolores Productivity Tools.</h3><p>We think of Dolores as that assistant who exists only in legend but we all wish we had; who always knows what you’re doing, who you’re talking to, what meeting you are in and simply keeps track of it all behind the scenes.  We’ve built software to use your current activity, with minimal interruptions, across all the devices you are already using to automatically compile that work into detailed time logs. So at any time, you can simply click a button, see a detailed report of your entire day, and then make any changes or notes if necessary. (Dolores is pretty good at her job after all, so we don't expect much editing required.)  Gone are the days of remembering to start and stop timers, jotting a note on a scrap piece of paper reminding you of the 30 minute call you had driving between meetings, or filling in a time card to guestimate your billables.  Dolores saves you the time and effort of creating billing reports and gives you & your clients’ full auditability of what work went into those invoices.  Then at the end of your billing cycle, as opposed to having to try and fill in gaps to get your invoices to reflect the work you actually did, you simply click another button and all your invoices are sent off to clients.  Speeding up your billing by days or weeks, because as you already know, time IS money.</p>
